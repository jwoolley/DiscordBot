################### TODO â€“- Started 5/31/16 ###################

* fork from discordbot repo and rebase with current changes
** https://github.com/chalda/DiscordBot

* cull extraneous features

* refactor command code to accept list of perms/permsets in constructor
** automatically check for a valid perm/permset on command, rather than coding to check per-command

* add (file-based) config option for which commands to enable

* check die rolls
** announce winner!
** keep track of low and high rolls
*** and any others: doubles/triples, repeated digits, etc.
** need to identify bots / dice command (so it can't by hacked by simple typing!)

* permissions feature - check / add / revoke
** retain in memory
** save to mongo and load on startup
** only admins can use feature
** allow granting admin to other users? or maybe moderator
*** perhaps govern with masteradmin perm
*** masteradmin cannot have perms revoked
** permsets/roles could include multiple perms

* save credentials to db and attempt to load on startup.
** provide command-line options for username+password.
** can avoid storing plaintext credentials in auth.json file
** also support other credentials/tokens (e.g. youtube API)
*** load via json file passed as command line option
*** store in DB on startup. user can then delete file or remove from git repo

* encrypted auth token for GG user authentication
** encrypt on profile page, include username/id
** user messages encrypted token to bot, who authenticates
** admin can run !checkauth command to see discord users' auth records
*** store auth records in mongoDB
**** include GG username, timestamp, (token, for debugging? store in DB at least)

* playgame command
** lists available games

* guesscard game
** show a snippet of magic card art. users guess which card by name
** fetch image/name via CURL/API, crop image with imagemagick etc.
** store in DB for future use  
** max # of guesses per player / overall
** !!guesscard moreguesses will allow addming more guesses
*** could provied [nomoreguesses] option when starting game, for 'official' games
